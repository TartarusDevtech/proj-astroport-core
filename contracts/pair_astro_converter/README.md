# Astroport Astro Converter Pair Contract

This is chain agnostic virtual pair which doesn't hold any liquidity and allows to convert old ASTRO -> new ASTRO. 
Path new ASTRO -> old ASTRO is not supported.
Pair doesn't charge any fees and is meant to serve as a seamless "bridge" between Astroport frontend and 
ASTRO converter contract.
